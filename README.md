# Chess-game-
Built a full-stack chess web app using Flask, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. Implemented a complete chess engine with legal move generation, check/checkmate detection, and all special rules. Added persistent gameplay via stored game states and move history, improving responsiveness and reducing load time.
